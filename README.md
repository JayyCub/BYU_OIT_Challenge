# BYU_OIT_Challenge
#### Created by Jacob Thomsen on March 29th, 2022

## About
This program can convert whole, decimal numbers to Roman Numerals, or the opposite, Roman Numerals to decimal numbers.
This project was created as my coding challenge submission for the position of BYU OIT Student Developer

## How to Use
To run this program, clone this repository, open the folder on your local computer, run `make compile`, and then run `make run`.

### Notes
This program took me approximately 3.45 hours to complete. The only requirement not met is Roman Numeral rule #4 is not checked. This program
should not require any external libraries or files. Also github uploaded the image of my notes very large, its hard to view online 
but should be fine if downloaded or right-clicked and viewed in new tab.
